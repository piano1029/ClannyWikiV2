# How to get a ROBLOSECURITY Token

:::danger
ROBLOSECURITY Tokens grant full access to the account, **never share** this token, **do not use your personal account**, **use an account specially for clanny**.
You can share this token with us because of the following reasons:
- We encrypt the token securely
- Its an account created specifically for Clanny
- The account **shouldn't** have access to any Robux

**CLANNY STAFF WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR THIS TOKEN** (If they do we will fire them)

This **requires a computer**

## Creating an account

:::info
This guide can also be used to create a **very** secure Roblox account for other purposes!
:::

Go to https://roblox.com, you will go to the account creation panel. If you do not, you have not configured your browser correctly.
When creating the account make sure of the following things:
- Its birthday is over 13 years
- It has a strong password (https://passwordsgenerator.net/)

## Secure your account

Go to the settings menu, then do the following things in their categories

### Account Info

- Add and verify an email address (You might have to reload the page and login again after this change)
- Set it to dark mode to preserve your retinas

### Security

- Turn on "Retrieve codes from an authenticator app to confirm your identity"
- Turn on "Email codes to confirm your identity"
- Download the recovery codes

## Get the ROBLOSECURITY

Open the devtools:

- Chrome: F12 / Right mouse button --> Open devtools
- Microsoft Edge: F12 / Right mouse button --> Open devtools
- Mozilla Firefox: F12 / Right mouse button --> Open devtools
- Safari: Safari (top bar) --> Preferences --> Advanced --> Enable "Show Develop in menu bar." --> Close Preferences --> Option + Cmd + i (Or instead of OptionCmdI do Developer (top bar) --> Open web inspector)

Now open the application tab in the devtools window, in some cases it might be hidden, most browsers will show ">>" in that case, press that then press Application.
Once you did that you need to open the Roblox cookies

Now scroll until you find `.ROBLOSECURITY`, double click the value (starting with `_|WARNING:-DO-NOT-SHARE-THIS`). Now press Control + C or Command + C depending on your system and you have the cookie!
:::warning
As mentioned above, never share this cookie. (To see why its secure to share with us, read the red block above)
